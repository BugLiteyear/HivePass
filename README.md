# HivePass ‚Äì Team Credential Vault (Browser Extension)

> **TL;DR**: HivePass lets developers and QA securely share **project‚Äëspecific website credentials** right from the browser. One teammate saves creds once; everyone on the project can use them‚Äîno more pinging people for logins. **Do not store personal emails** here, and **company email accounts are blocked** by design.

## ‚ú® What is HivePass?

HivePass is a lightweight browser extension for internal testing environments. It stores and auto‚Äëfills **non‚Äëpersonal** credentials for websites under development at your IT firm, so devs/testers don‚Äôt have to ask around for access.
